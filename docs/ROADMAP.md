# Roadmap (Post-MVP)

## Next Priority

1. Entry-level AI chat over transcript + artifacts.
2. Folder-level retrieval and chat over multiple entries.
3. Cross-folder comparison workflows.

## Suggested Technical Additions

- Embedding index per entry and per folder
- Retrieval pipeline with chunking + citation links to transcript segments
- Prompt presets for comparison tasks (hiring quality, sales pattern drift, CS churn signals)
- Background job queue and progress UI for long-running indexing
